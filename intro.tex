\chapter{Introduction}

Welcome to the very beginnings of The OpenAMD Manual.
We hope that this document grows to detail exactly how
the various components of the OpenAMD project function
and communicate with each other
as well as how to set them up.
%\autoref{fig:intro:overview} shows
%a high-level picture of the components
%and their interconnections.

OpenAMD is a ``location-aware social network''.
